   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pypact's documentation!

Pypact's original aim was to make FISPACT-II output files easy to parse so that more time can be spent on analysis,
and much less time on interrogating the output file. No more convoluted scripts, just one simple to use package!
However, it has evolved beyond that to provide a utility library for FISPACT-II, not just parsing output files,
but also writing input files (fluxes, files, inputs), data manipulation, group convert, plotting, and more!

These documentation pages will hopefully show you how it works and provide examples how you can use it.
